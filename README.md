# Pop a Squat
Pop a Squat will be a simple VR game that involves walls coming at you, and you must squat under them. This is meant to be a very customizable workout tool featuring functionality over bells and whistles.

#Intended base features:
  - You will be able to specify how many walls you want to go through
  - Customize how fast the walls come
  - Customize the distance between walls
  - Customize the thickness of the walls
  - Have basic "Beginner", "Intermediate", and "Expert" levels of these settings
  - Show how many squats have been completed
  - Calibrate hole height based on user's height
  - Explain proper squatting form while loading
  - Display disclaimer that I am not responsible for personal injury before being allowed to proceed

#Potential future enhancements:
  - Keep track of scores online
  - Allow for goal setting (e.g. 1000 squats a week)
  - Wall stops in front of you, you must duck walk under it.
  - Walls come that you have to jump over (pending if HMD can stay on head even when strapped on tight)
  - Walls have holes in different spots so you have to move around
  - Companion Android app that monitors your form to ensure you're squatting correctly
  - Music, including importing your own or searching youtube
  - Announcer to cheer you on ("Just 3 more! You can do it!")
  - Fancy background
